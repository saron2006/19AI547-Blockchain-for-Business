# Experiment 2: Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding (Kickstarter Alternative)
## Aim:
To create a decentralized crowdfunding platform where donors contribute funds only if the campaign goal is met.

## Algorithm:
1. **Create Campaign** – Deploy smart contract with goal, deadline, and details.  
2. **Contribute Funds** – Backers send funds to the smart contract.  
3. **Check Outcome (After Deadline)** –  
   - If goal met → funds go to creator.  
   - If goal not met → backers can refund.  
4. **Withdraw/Refund** – Creator withdraws or backers claim refund.  
5. **Ensure Transparency** – All actions are logged on blockchain.

1. **Successful Campaign**: Goal met, funds released to creator.  
2. **Unsuccessful Campaign**: Goal not met, backers can claim refunds.  
3. **Transparent Records**: All contributions and transactions visible on blockchain.  
4. **No Manual Control**: Smart contract automates fund handling securely.

# RESULT: 
The result shows whether the campaign succeeded (funds go to creator) or failed (backers get refunds), with all actions transparently recorded on the blockchain.
